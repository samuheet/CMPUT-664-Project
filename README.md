**Important:** Other components might be needed as per the individual software.

Projects:

1. [OWASP Benchmark](https://github.com/OWASP/Benchmark) - A Java test suite designed to evaluate the accuracy, coverage, and speed of automated software vulnerability detection tools. 

2. [Vulnerable Web Application](https://github.com/OWASP/Vulnerable-Web-Application) - This app categorically includes Command Execution, File Inclusion, File Upload, SQL and XSS vulnerabilities.

3. [OWASP WebGoat.NET](https://github.com/OWASP/WebGoat.NET) - A vulnerable web application built on .NET Framework.
