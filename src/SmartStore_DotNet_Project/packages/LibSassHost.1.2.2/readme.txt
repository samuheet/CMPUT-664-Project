   DESCRIPTION
   ===========
   .NET wrapper around the LibSass (http://sass-lang.com/libsass) with the ability
   to support a virtual file system.

   you need to choose and install the most appropriate package(s) for your platform.
   The following packages are available:

    * LibSassHost.Native.win-x86
    * LibSassHost.Native.win-x64
    * LibSassHost.Native.linux-x64
    * LibSassHost.Native.osx-x64
